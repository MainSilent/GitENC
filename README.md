# GitENC

Encrypt and Decrypt all your repository data, And push or clone with one command.

I sometimes have very sensitive codes that even making the repository private isn't enough, I want to make sure if someone gain access to the repo they can't read the code as a clear text.

So I decided to work on this project and also get more experience with rust.

Note: There are other projects with the same name or purpose but they don't have the requirements that I need, I need a simple command to compress and encrypt the data and when clonning do the reverse.

BTW this project is my first experience with rust and only linux is supported.
